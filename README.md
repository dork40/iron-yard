# High Noon Showdown

High Noon Showdown v3.4.1 is an original Wild West browser game with local player progression, synthesized Web Audio effects, an AI-only Ghost Challenge personal-best race, casual multiplayer, and a live 3D 1v1 arena. It contains no borrowed characters, art, sounds, maps, dialogue, or branding.

## v3.4.1 Build Fix

Adds the Three.js TypeScript declarations required by Vercel, so the WebGL arena build can complete.

## v3.4.0 Three-Dimensional Arena

Iron Yard now renders its compact multiplayer arena with Three.js/WebGL and locally generated textures. The release also fixes player movement being overwritten by server snapshots.

## Iron Yard Arena Mode

Iron Yard is an original compact 1v1 arena shooter rendered with Three.js/WebGL, with procedural brick, concrete, and floor textures, first-person mouse look, WASD movement, two weapon loadouts, and a live rival. Start it from `PLAY`, select **Iron Yard**, then create a room code or join a friend's. The dedicated WebSocket server provides 15 Hz player-state snapshots and server-side hit/damage resolution. It does not use or imitate third-party shooter branding or assets.

## v3.1.0 Visual Refresh

The frontier interface now uses a more deliberate saloon-print visual system: clearer heading and label hierarchy, stronger selected and focus states, consistent panel and button treatment, compact active navigation, and refined lobby, profile, scoreboard, tutorial, and game surfaces. The expanded navigation remains usable on small screens through a touch-scrollable navigation row; no routes, modes, controls, or game behavior changed.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Supabase values enable the existing shared multiplayer modes; `VITE_ARENA_SERVER_URL` enables Iron Yard. Use `npm run build` to type-check and create a production build.

## Controls

- Quick Draw: click, tap, or press Space after `DRAW!`. On phones, the wait state has no shoot control; a large safe-area-aware Shoot button appears only at the signal.
- Beat Your Best / Ghost Challenge: use Quick Draw controls to beat your saved personal-best reaction. Before a record exists, the game labels a 1500 ms starter target; the first successful draw becomes your record.
- Word Duel: type the shown word in either uppercase or lowercase, then press Enter.
- Trail Trace: press and hold on the canvas, follow the winding gold path, then release to submit a score based on progress and accuracy.
- Rock Paper Scissors: choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors simultaneously in a best-of-five match; first to three round wins takes the match.
- Sound: use the visible `MUTE` / `UNMUTE` control. Web Audio starts only after interaction and safely does nothing when unavailable.
- Navigation: the top navigation is ordered `HOME`, `PLAY`, `MULTI`, `MUTE` / `UNMUTE`, and `HOW TO PLAY`. `HOME` and the High Noon Showdown brand return to the main menu; `PLAY` opens AI modes and `MULTI` opens multiplayer.
- During any versus-AI or live multiplayer duel, select `FULL SCREEN` to expand the game. Select `EXIT FULL SCREEN`, or use the browser's fullscreen exit gesture, to return.

## Multiplayer Setup

1. In Supabase Authentication, enable anonymous sign-ins.
2. Run this idempotent block in the Supabase SQL Editor. It creates the private-room table, Quick Game queue, Realtime publication entries, and browser-safe policies/RPCs for users signed in anonymously (the Supabase `authenticated` role).

In the Supabase dashboard, Database > Replication is the equivalent place to enable `duel_rooms` and `quick_match_queue`.

Set these public Vite environment variables in your static-host build configuration:

```text
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-or-publishable-key
VITE_ARENA_SERVER_URL=https://authority.example
```

Use the project's publishable/anon key only. Never expose a service-role key in Vite client variables. Rebuild after changing public variables because Vite embeds them at build time.

## Modes And Controls

- **Original Quick Draw:** after a random 2-6 second wait, `DRAW!` appears. Click, tap, or press `Space` once to shoot before the AI reacts. The reaction clock starts with `performance.now()` immediately after the local `DRAW!` UI is rendered and interactive. Mobile AI and live rounds show a wait-only state without a shoot control, then reveal a large tap-safe Shoot button at `DRAW!`.
- **Beat Your Best / Ghost Challenge:** an AI-only Quick Draw race against your saved personal-best reaction, using the same random wait, local `performance.now()` clock, and false-start rules. Beat the target to win and immediately replace it with your faster time. With no saved personal best, the clearly labeled approachable **1500 ms starter target** is used; your first success becomes the record. Ghost Challenge is not available in rooms, Quick Game, or Showdown Series.
- **Word Duel:** after a random wait, type `SHOOT`, `DRAW`, or `POW` exactly and press Enter. Its local reaction clock starts immediately after the word input is rendered and enabled.
- **Trail Trace:** trace the generated winding target line with a mouse, touch, or pen. The final score combines farthest target progress with average line accuracy, with a small completion bonus.
- **Bottle Shot:** a 30-second target range with six smaller, touch-accessible bottles visible at once. Click or tap each active bottle once to break it: green and blue bottles add +10, while the more-common red bottles subtract 10. A shot or tap on the range that misses an active bottle also subtracts 10. A new seeded six-bottle wave appears every 1.5 seconds; Ash's target hits, red-bottle mistakes, and range misses vary by difficulty.
- **Rock Paper Scissors:** a simultaneous best-of-five, first-to-three match. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock; matching choices tie and replay without awarding a round.
- **Iron Yard:** live 1v1 Three.js/WebGL arena shooting. Create a room code or join one, click the arena to capture the mouse, move with `WASD`, aim with the mouse, fire with click or `FIRE`, and reload with `R` or `RELOAD`. `Escape` releases the mouse. The dedicated arena WebSocket server controls capacity, state broadcasts, hit resolution, health, and results; it requires `VITE_ARENA_SERVER_URL`.
- **Showdown Series:** best of five, first to three wins. A lightweight cinematic title card opens the series, then every round reveals its randomly selected Quick Draw, Word Duel, Trail Trace, Bottle Shot, or Rock Paper Scissors test with a three-second countdown. The persistent series strip shows score, round, revealed test, and the next controller; win/loss announcements lead into a final champion screen with rematch and return controls. Ghost Challenge is excluded. In multiplayer, the prior-round winner controls the next round; a tie returns control to the host for a replay.
- In every AI mode, acting before the signal is a false start and loses the round.

Before starting a versus-AI mode, choose Ash Mercer's difficulty: **Easy** reacts randomly in 1200-2200 ms and traces around 48-72 points, **Normal** reacts randomly in 550-1400 ms and traces around 68-88 points, and **Hard** reacts randomly in 250-650 ms and traces around 84-98 points. Trail Trace begins immediately; the two existing signal modes keep their random 2-6 second waiting period. The active difficulty appears during the AI duel, and wins, losses, and the fastest successful reaction remain stored locally when browser storage is available.

## Multiplayer Behavior

Create a six-character private room code or join an available room as before. Quick Game selects a mode and queues the signed-in player; the next player requesting that same mode is atomically paired into a new `duel_rooms` row. A search remains queued when navigating away and is restored on return. Realtime delivers changes promptly, while a 2.5-second authenticated queue fetch checks for a missed event or a reconnect; only one local subscription/poll loop is active and cancel or leave stops it. Both sessions then subscribe to the room and can mark themselves ready. Cancel Search only removes an unmatched queue entry.

When both players are ready, the round controller briefly allows an in-flight peer handshake up to 1.2 seconds to settle, then writes a shared future `startAt` padded by at least 3 seconds with direct transport or 4.5 seconds on database fallback (plus the normal random draw wait where applicable). Each joined room creates one `RTCPeerConnection` using public STUN servers. Supabase Realtime Broadcast carries SDP/ICE signaling only; after the DataChannel opens, the guest sends five clock pings and estimates its offset from the host using the lowest-round-trip sample. Each browser converts that shared target to its local monotonic `performance.now()` timeline, arms the signal locally, renders/enables it, and only then records the reaction clock. If no peer link is available, browsers still use the padded shared timestamp, but start alignment is less precise.

For Quick Draw and Word Duel, each browser renders and activates its own signal/control before recording `performance.now()`. A shot or correct word reports elapsed milliseconds from that local mark through both the DataChannel event and the durable `round_state` action, so displayed reaction results are local measurements rather than stale signal or wall-clock timestamps. The host compares those measured values, not database/action arrival timestamps. Reactions within 3 ms are a tie; a short 1.2-second fallback window lets a missing peer action arrive before a lone valid reaction is awarded. Actions before a local activation are false starts; two false starts tie.

For Trail Trace, the deterministic path is scored locally and a submission is accepted only when it reaches the final target with at least 95% progress and 55% accuracy. Multiplayer repeats those bounds checks before accepting a payload. Bottle Shot uses a host-created `targetSeed`, shared `startAt`, and `endAt` exactly 30 seconds later. Rock Paper Scissors choices are sent simultaneously, revealed once both arrive, and ties replay without a point. The host may use an already received peer action as an early resolution hint, but the database state remains the fallback record.

### Transport Guarantees And Limits

- A connected DataChannel gives direct browser-to-browser delivery for live actions, a small guest-to-host clock-offset estimate, and reduced dependence on database subscription latency. The padded start and monotonic local arming reduce avoidable startup skew; they do not guarantee a fixed latency, exact clock alignment, an identical rendered frame, ordering across the database fallback, delivery after disconnect, or perfect fairness.
- STUN-only WebRTC works on many networks but cannot traverse every symmetric NAT, carrier network, enterprise firewall, VPN, or browser privacy policy. An optional authenticated TURN relay can improve this when deployed; unavailable/missing/rejected relay credentials remain on the Supabase database fallback.
- WebRTC requires a current browser with `RTCPeerConnection` and DataChannel support. Unsupported or failed connections continue with Supabase state updates.
- This remains **client-timed casual play**, not cheat-proof or server-authoritative timing. A client can tamper with its measured reaction, clock-ping replies, choices, or scores. Different clocks, timer throttling, rendering/compositor delays, input-device latency, network asymmetry, and fallback database delivery can still affect perceived fairness; direct peer transport does not remove those limits.

### SQL Requirement

Existing users who have not applied the v3.2.2 SQL block must rerun it. v3.4.0 adds no Supabase schema migration: Series presentation uses the existing shared round, score, and next-round-controller fields. Ghost Challenge remains local-only.

## Profile, Queues, And Authority

`PROFILE` stores a display name, original frontier title, badges, streaks, mode results, and best successful draw locally in browser storage. It requires no external account. Room hosts and guests share the display name they entered only in that room's `round_state`; do not use it for identity or moderation.

Multiplayer begins with an explicit **Casual** or **Ranked** choice. Casual is the existing Supabase/WebRTC implementation, so its P2P/fallback badge and the limits above remain visible. Ranked intentionally cannot queue, simulate a match, or award a ranking in this release. A real ranked deployment needs authoritative timing, verified identities, durable match records, anti-abuse controls, and an operational endpoint.

`VITE_AUTHORITY_URL` is optional and must be an HTTPS URL (or localhost during development). It enables only optional TURN relay lookup, never ranked play. The client reads a short-lived authenticated TURN ticket from `sessionStorage["high-noon-turn-ticket"]`; a trusted identity service must issue that ticket after authenticating the player. The client sends it to `GET /v1/turn-credentials` as a bearer token, validates the credential response, and visibly falls back to STUN/Supabase when the URL, ticket, origin, response, relay, or browser support is unavailable. Do not place a TURN secret or long-lived ticket in any `VITE_` variable. See [`server/README.md`](server/README.md) for the signed-ticket protocol, exact CORS origin rules, coturn configuration, and Docker deployment.

`VITE_ARENA_SERVER_URL` is required for Iron Yard and must be the HTTPS base URL of the deployed authority service (or `http://localhost:8080` for local development). The browser derives its `ws:`/`wss:` connection to `/v1/arena`; this value is public build configuration, not a credential. Set the server's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the exact Vite site origin.

## Validation

GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/build.yml` installs and builds both the browser client and `server/` on every push and pull request. The repository intentionally has no lockfile, so the workflow uses `npm install` rather than `npm ci`.
